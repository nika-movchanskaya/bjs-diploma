# Diploma project for course «Basics of JavaScript»

This is a site for crypto-startup.
We can buy internal currency of the company - Netcoin, give this currency to other users of this service.
There is an interface fir interacting with the API (backend, where transactions between user and funds take place), and an interface for interacting with the DOM (grafical interface, that you see in browser). And we have to connect these 2 parts: to do so, that the data entered by the user is sent to the server, and the information provided by the server is displayed to the user.
